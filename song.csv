Hello Little Girl,"Hello little girl hello little girl hello little girl.  When I see you everyday, I say: mm mm hello little girl. When you're passing on your way I say: mm mm hello little girl. When I see you passing by I cry mm mm hello little girl. When I try to catch your eye I cry mm mm hello little girl.  I send you flowers but you don't care. You never seem to see me standing there. I often wonder what you're thinking of. I hope it's me and love love love.  So I hope there'll come a day mm you're my little girl.
