Took her out and tried to win her, Had a laugh and over dinner, Told her I would really like to see her again, Got the bill and Rita paid it, Took her home I nearly made it, Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. Oh, Lovely Rita meter maid, Where would I be without you, Give us a wink and make me think of you. Lovely Rita meter maid Lovely Rita meter maid Lovely Rita meter maid"
Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

If I'd been out 'till quarter to three Would you lock the door, Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four? You'll be older too, Any if you say the word, I could stay with you. I could be handy, mending a fuse When your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside Sunday mornings go for a ride, Doing the garden, digging the weeds, Who could ask for more. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four? Every summer we can rent a cottage, In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear We shall scrimp and save Grandchildren on your knee Vera, Chuck, and Dave. Send me a postcard, drop me a line, Stating point of view Indicate precisely what you mean to say Yours sincerely, wasting away Give me your answer, fill in a form Mine for evermore Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four?"

While My Guitar Gently Weeps,I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you. I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps Look at you all... Still my guitar gently weeps.

Within You Without You,"We were talking-about the space between us all And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pass away. We were talking-about the love we could share-when we find it To try our best to hold it there-with our love With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew. Try to realize it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on within you and without you. We were talking-about the love that's gone so cold and the people, Who gain the world and lose their soul They don't know-they can't see-are you one of them? When you've seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you."
